I am a Data Scientist, Research Associate, developer.
I love implementing interesting ideas and believe only by implementing them can I evaluate how good they are.

My background is Information Retrieval (**Computer Science**).
During my Ph.D., I studied location information in terms of social media users' trail patterns.
Most of code I wrote for my study is in **Python**.
Sometimes I need the power from **Hadoop**/**Spark** for scale up my analysis.

I love **Scala** and have a great experience of using it in my project [MintSearch](https://github.com/spacelis/mintsearch).
Other languages I can speak are Java, SQL, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

I also developed [CDRC Data](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk), which is a data portal based on [CKAN](https://ckan.org).
To customize the CKAN, I developed a plugin which includes various changes to the original CKAN, include a two-phase dataset reviewing procedure.
The whole infrastructure is running within **Docker** containers created from a heavily customized Debian image with initialization scripts.
A lot of scripts were written around the Docker containers to support backup/restore, debugging instance building, etc.
