I am a Data Scientist, Research Associate, developer.
I love implementing interesting ideas and believe only by implementing them can I evaluate how good they are.

My background is Information Retrieval (**Computer Science**).
During my Ph.D., I studied location information in terms of social media users' trail patterns.
Most of code I wrote for my study is in **Python**.
Sometimes I need the power from **Hadoop**/**Spark** for scale up my analysis.
**Scala** is one of my favourite language and using it in my project [MintSearch](https://github.com/spacelis/mintsearch) and data analysis on Spark is really great.
I also speak other languages, for example, Java, SQL, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

Here are some of my projects:

 - [**MintSearch**](https://github.com/spacelis/mintsearch): A test bed for graph search by integrating Neo4J and Terrier. //Scala
 - [**CDRC Data**](https://github.com/ESRC-CDRC/ckan-ckanext-cdrc): A data portal website based on the CKAN serving data sets and metadata held by CDRC. //Python/JavaScript/HTML/CSS
 - [**Portraitist2**](https://github.com/spacelis/portraitist2): A plot dashboard tool for displaying different types of data interactively based on dc.js. [Demo](http://portraitist-dmir.rhcloud.com/) //JavaScript/HTML
 - [**BakMan**](https://github.com/spacelis/bakman): A file based backup managing helper tool, with which user can select a subset of files by rules. //Python
 - [**lazylist**](https://github.com/spacelis/lazylist): A toy stream-like structure written in Python trying to mimic the Stream in Scala. //Python
 - [**lispy**](https://github.com/spacelis/lispy): A toy project of building Lisp interpreter in Python. //Python
