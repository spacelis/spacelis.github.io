      <description>My work requires me importing a variety tables from CSV to DBMS. However, importing CSV is not always an easy and documentable task, as every DBMS has its own way of doing the job. There are different tools, be it GUI or CUI, that can help the process but there lacks a tool generally available for the task.

      <description>If you ever had tons of backup files which quickly fill up all your disk space, this tool might be useful to you. Bakman is a BAcKup MANagement tool for automatically tracing unneeded backup files and generating management scripts. The core idea is to filtering backup files by a set of customizable rules. The rule file will define which files in the piles should be removed or stashed somewhere else.</description>
